> It's the colorscheme we set that defines us. *(Batman)*

Gotham is a **very dark** Pentadactyl colorscheme. It was built for vim
([link][vim-gotham] to vim colorscheme), but has been since ported to other
platforms (see [gotham-contrib][gotham-contrib] repository).

## Installation

To install this colorscheme, copy [`gotham.penta`][gotham.penta] to
`~/.pentadactyl/colors/` directory.

Then try it by running `:colorscheme gotham`.

You can set it as your default colorscheme by adding the following
to your `~/.pentadactylrc`:

    colorscheme gotham
